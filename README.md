This code takes in data points written in form of matrix in txt file where each row represent one data point, then it preforms clustering using "Kmeans" method. But this code has the advantage of being an interactive GUI tool that allows the user to do many things as shown in the video to ba able to study in details the affect of initial positions of the clusters centers and the evolution of the clustering process even the user can control the speed of this process. This tool can be used as an educational tool for the kmeans algorithm or to study in details how the process of clustering of certain group of data is done. 

The code is implemented in Matlab and is very easy to use as shown in the video
